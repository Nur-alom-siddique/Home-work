    is full of
    incomprehensible possibilities in the development of Bangladesh.

    During the regime of Delhi emperor Tughlaq, a Muslim warrior named Gazi settled in this region. At that time the
    area
    was forested. Gazi cleaned many forested areas in the region and made them suitable for habitation. Later, his
    descendants ruled this area for a long time. People named this area Gazipur to show respect for their good
    governance.

    Gazipur has a heroic role in many movements of Bangladesh during the British and Pakistan era. The first armed
    resistance war took place in Gazipur on March 19, 1971, at the beginning of the great liberation war of the
    country.

    A major part of the garment industries are located in this district. Along with the apparel industry, the district
    has
    many other small, medium, and large industries. There are many headquarters of different national organizations
    and
    universities, and the country's only hi-tech park is located in this district.
